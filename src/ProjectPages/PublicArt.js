            <h1>PROBLEM SPACE</h1>
            <p>We know that public art increases the livability of a city by giving the citizens a sense of identity and a landmark where they can feel proud of living there. However, in Pittsburgh, public art does not play a strong role in peopleâ€™s lives. We want to figure out a way where we can encourage people to feel more connected with the city through public art.</p>
